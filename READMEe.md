# What is this?

A collection of 50 backend/low level projects that should all be able to be completed in a week. I did this because I didn't know what I wanted to build and told myself I will make a list of 50 and do them no matter what. These projects are beginner to intermediate difficulty. Each project resides in its own directory.
